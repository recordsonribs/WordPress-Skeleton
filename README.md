# Records On Ribs WordPress

Our WordPress setup. Uses [Mark Jaquith](http://markjaquith.com/)'s [WordPress Skeleton](https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton) as a starting point.

## Plugins Used

We manage our WordPress plugins using [Git submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules). We have tried to find the latest SVN mirrors for each and in the event where they are missing created our own. See our [.gitmodules](https://github.com/recordsonribs/wordpress/blob/master/.gitmodules) for full details.
