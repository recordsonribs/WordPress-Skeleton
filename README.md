# Records On Ribs WordPress Skeleton

Our WordPress setup. Uses [Mark Jaquith](http://markjaquith.com/)'s [WordPress Skeleton](https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Skeleton) as a starting point.

We manage our WordPress themes and plugins using [Git submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules). We have tried to find the latest SVN mirrors for each and in the event where they are missing created our own. 

See our [.gitmodules](https://github.com/recordsonribs/wordpress/blob/master/.gitmodules) for full details. How long does this all take to clone? Around 2 minutes.

We deploy using [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) inspired by Mark Jaquith's other excellent project [WP-Stack](https://github.com/markjaquith/WP-Stack).

## Theme

We are using our current WordPress theme, [ror](https://github.com/recordsonribs/ror).
